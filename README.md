# linux-user-env

## What to expect in this repo?
This is where I'll store some user-config files.
I plan to add some RC files, and freedesktop files.

## Why such repo?
My goal is that I don't lose them from computer to computer, and can enhance them over time.
Having feedback from other people is definitely a plus
