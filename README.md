# linux-user-env

## What to expect in this repo?
This is where I'll store some user-config files.
I plan to add some RC files, and freedesktop files.

## Why such repo?
My goal is that I don't lose them from computer to computer, and can enhance them over time.
Having feedback from other people is definitely a plus

## How to use this repo?
1. Copy RC files (like `.bashrc`) to your ~, and relaunch your session to ensure they are sourced
2. In your `Bureau` folder (depending on your locale), cp the `.desktop` files (they should be sourced automatically, and appear on your desktop)
